# Project Status

## Completed Tasks

1. Created the main application file `app.py`
2. Implemented database utility functions in `database_utils.py`
3. Developed natural language processing utilities in `nlp_utils.py`
4. Set up CrewAI components, including agents and tasks, in `crewai_components.py`
5. Created a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary dependencies
6. Set up a template for `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to store the Anthropic API key
7. Developed a comprehensive README.md file explaining the project and its usage
8. Created this STATUS.md file to track project progress

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with sample UK Biobank CSV files
2. Implement error handling and input validation
3. Optimize database queries for large datasets
4. Add data visualization features to enhance analysis presentation
5. Implement user authentication if dealing with sensitive data
6. Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines
7. Write unit tests for critical components
8. Create documentation for API endpoints and functions
9. Optimize the application for performance and scalability

## Known Issues

- The application has not been tested with actual UK Biobank data
- Performance with very large datasets needs to be evaluated
- Error handling might need improvement for edge cases

## Future Enhancements

- Implement caching for frequently asked questions
- Add support for more complex natural language queries
- Integrate with other AI models for enhanced analysis
- Develop a user management system for multi-user scenarios
- Create a RESTful API for programmatic access to the query system
